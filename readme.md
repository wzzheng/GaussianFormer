## Overview
![comparisons](./images/comparisons.png)

Considering the universal approximating ability of Gaussian mixture, we propose an object-centric 3D semantic Gaussian representation to describe the fine-grained structure of 3D scenes without the use of dense grids. We propose a GaussianFormer model consisting of sparse convolution and cross-attention to efficiently transform 2D images into 3D Gaussian representations. To generate dense 3D occupancy, we design a Gaussian-to-voxel splatting module that can be efficiently implemented with CUDA. With comparable performance, our GaussianFormer reduces memory consumption of existing 3D occupancy prediction methods by 75.2% - 82.2%.
